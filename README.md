# Running in development environment
Running the application requires npm and Node. First, there needs to be a `.env` file in the `api` folder. The file needs to have `JWT_SECRET` variable used for signing JWT tokens. Example: `JWT_SECRET=verysecretkey`. The server can be run in a development environment by first installing required packages with `npm install` in the `api` folder and then starting the server with `node app.js`. The React front-end can be run by first installing the required packages with `npm install` in the `react-app` folder and then starting with `npm start`.
